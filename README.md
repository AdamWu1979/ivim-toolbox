# ivim-toolbox
This toolbox is dedicated to model fitting and simulation for Intra-Voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) MR imaging. It gathers scripts, on the one hand, to fit IVIM bi-exponential signal representation voxel-wise and, on the other hand, to run Monte Carlo simulations in order to assess the estimation error on parameters as well as the minimum required SNR to get accurate estimation.
