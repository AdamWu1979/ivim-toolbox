<p align="center">
This toolbox is dedicated to model fitting and simulation for Intra-Voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) MR imaging. It gathers tools, on the one hand, to fit IVIM bi-exponential signal representation voxel-wise and, on the other hand, to run Monte Carlo simulations in order to assess the estimation error on parameters as well as to calculate the minimum required SNR to get accurate estimation.</p>

We thank you for choosing our toolbox! :heart: According to the MIT licence, please cite the following article:

# Operating systems
This toolbox is only based on Python. Therefore, it should run on any OS (Mac OSX, Linux, Windows). However, it has been developed and extensively tested on Mac OSX. Some light errors might pop up when using on Linux or Windows but **feel free to open an issue [here](https://github.com/slevyrosetti/ivim-toolbox/issues) or to contact me at simon.levy@mines-ales.org if you face any problem.**

# Installation
Only requirements are:
  1. Python
  2. Specific Python modules (i.e. not installed in default Python)
  3. ivim-toolbox files
  
  ## 1. Python
We recommend to install Python through the [Conda package](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/). It is very easy, follow the link, select your Operating System and run the installer (either for Miniconda or Anaconda).
You can also download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

  ## 2. Specific Python modules
Once Python is intalled, install the required Python modules:
  - lmfit
  - argparse
  - nibabel
  - multiprocessing
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - cPickle
  - wxpython
  
To do so, just open a Terminal and, for each module, type `conda install <module name>` where `<module name>` has to be replaced by the name of the module.

*Some modules such as `numpy`, `nibabel` or `matplotlib` are already included in the Conda package so no need to install them.
You can also update modules typing `conda update <module name>`.*

If you did not install Python through the Conda package, you can install those modules typing `pip install <module name>`.

*The `pip` command should be available on default Python but if not, you can find information on how to install it [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/). The command to update modules with `pip` is `pip install <module name> --upgrade`.*

  ## 3. ivim-toolbox
Finally, [download](https://github.com/slevyrosetti/ivim-toolbox/archive/master.zip) this repository. Add the path to your `.bash_profile` (or `.bashrc` as preferred). To do so, type the following command in a Terminal:

`echo 'export PATH=<path to ivim-toolbox directory>:$PATH' >>~/.bash_profile` where `<path to ivim-toolbox directory>` has to be replaced by the path to the ivim-toolbox directory (e.g. `/Users/slevyrosetti/ivim-toolbox`).

# Get started
You will find in the directory `test_data` example data that you can use to test your installation:
 - `dwi_rl.nii.gz` are human spinal cord IVIM data acquired at 7T with diffusion encoding in the Right-Left direction and with b-values as defined in `bval_rl.txt`
 - `dwi_ap.nii.gz` are human spinal cord IVIM data acquired at 7T with diffusion encoding in the Anterior-Posterior direction and with b-values as defined in `bval_rl.txt`
 - `dwi_is.nii.gz` are human spinal cord IVIM data acquired at 7T with diffusion encoding in the Inferior-Superior direction and with b-values as defined in `bval_rl.txt`
 - `cord_seg_dilated.nii.gz` is a large mask including the cord (to use for voxel-wise fitting)
 - directory `results_you_should_get` includes the results you should get using the example commands detailed below

Those data are the single-subject data presented in Figure 6 of the paper *Lévy S., Rapacchi S., Massire A., Troalen T., Feiweier T., Guye M., Callot V., Intra-Voxel Incoherent Motion at 7 Tesla to quantify human spinal cord microperfusion: limitations and promises, Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 1902:334-357, 2019.*

The tools available are:
  - `ivim_fitting.py`: fit IVIM biexponential signal representation to NIFTI data according to specified fitting approach
  - `ivim_simu_compute_error_nonoise.py`: compute error of a given fitting approach according to true IVIM values
  - `ivim_simu_plot_error_nonoise.py`: plot results from previous tool
  - `ivim_simu_compute_error_noise.py`: compute error of a given fitting approach according to true IVIM values for a given SNR (Monte Carlo simulations)
  - `ivim_simu_plot_error_noise.py`: plot results from previous tool
  - `ivim_simu_compute_required_snr.py`: compute required SNR to estimate parameters within 10% error margins for a given fitting approach and according to true IVIM values
  - `ivim_simu_plot_required_snr.py`: plot results from previous tool
  - `ivim_toolbox.py`: launch the graphical user interface
  
All tools can be used from the Terminal and some of the them can be run through a graphical user interface.

**To display all available options for any tool, type `<name of tool>.py --help` in a Terminal (e.g. `ivim_fitting.py --help`).**

## Example commands (to be run in a Terminal window)
### Open graphical user interface
```
ivim_toolbox.py
```
Two frames will open. The first is to fit the IVIM biexponential signal representation to NIFTI data according to specified fitting approach (similar to function `ivim_fitting.py`). The second is to compute required SNR to estimate parameters within 10% error margins for a given fitting approach and according to true IVIM values (similart to `ivim_simu_compute_required_snr.py`).

### Fit IVIM data
Go to the folder where the data are stored
```
cd test_data
```

Fit the IVIM data acquired with diffusion encoding in the Right-Left direction, voxel-by-voxel for voxels within the mask only, using the one-step fitting approach and running on all threads available to speed up the calculation. IVIM maps will be output in a folder named `ivim_maps_rl`
```
ivim_fitting.py -i dwi_rl.nii.gz -b bval_rl.txt -ma cord_seg_dilated.nii.gz -mo one-step -o ivim_maps_rl -mt 1
```

### Check performance of fitting algorithm on perfect data
Compute estimation error of the one-step fit approach on perfect data with f<sub>IVIM</sub> values varying from 1 to 30%, D* values varying from 3 to 35e-3 mm<sup>2</sup>/s and D varying from 0.2 to 2.9e-3 mm<sup>2</sup>/s; a result file will be created in folder `one_step_fit_err`:
```
ivim_simu_compute_error_nonoise.py -model one-step -ofolder one_step_fit_err -bval 5,10,20,30,50,75,150,250,600,700,800
```
Plot the results in folder "one_step_fit_err" with "error_plot" as output file name:
```
ivim_simu_plot_error_nonoise.py -input one_step_fit_err/sim_results_*.pkl -oname one_step_fit_err/error_plot
```

### Compute estimation error of fitting algorithm for a given SNR
Compute estimation error of the two-step fit approach on simulated data with SNR=180 (Monte-Carlo simulations) with IVIM true values varying in the same range as the previous one; similarly, a result file will be created in folder `two_step_fit_err_snr180`:
```
ivim_simu_compute_error_noise.py -model two-step -snr 180 -ofolder two_step_fit_err_snr180 -bval 5,10,20,30,50,75,150,250,600,700,800
```
Plot the results in folder "two_step_fit_err_snr180" with "error_plot" as output file name:
```
ivim_simu_plot_error_nonoise.py -input two_step_fit_err_snr180/sim_results_*.pkl -oname two_step_fit_err_snr180/error_plot
```

### Calculate required SNR
Calculate the minimum required SNR to estimate the product of parameters f<sub>IVIM</sub> and D* within 10% error margins for f<sub>IVIM</sub> varying from 1 to 30% (with 10 steps), D* varying from 3 to 35e-3 mm<sup>2</sup>/s (with 10 steps) and D equals 0.3 and 1.5e-3 mm<sup>2</sup>/s
```
ivim_simu_compute_required_snr.py -model one-step -ofolder required_snr_one_step_fit -bval 5,10,20,30,50,75,150,250,600,700,800 -condition FDstar -F 0.01:10:0.30 -Dstar 3.0e-3:10:35e-3 -D 0.3e-3,1.5e-3
```
A result file has been created to folder "required_snr_one_step_fit", let's plot the results now:
```
ivim_simu_plot_required_snr.py -input required_snr_one_step_fit/sim_results_*.pkl -oname required_snr_plot
```
